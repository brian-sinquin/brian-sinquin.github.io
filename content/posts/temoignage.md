{{< admonition type="abstract" title="Info" >}}
After my Ph.D defense, I had the oportunity to write an interview about my academic journey on a french blog dedicated to graduated Ph.D stories, in academia as in industry.

# **Can you introduce yourself and explain why you decided to pursue a PhD?**  

It was during my high school years that I developed a strong interest in physics. Naturally, I pursued a university degree at the University of Western Brittany in Brest (**UBO**). I first completed a Bachelor’s degree in Physics, followed by a Master’s degree in Fundamental and Applied Physics (**PFA**), a joint program with the University of Rennes, ENSSAT, and ENIB, specializing in Photonics. Throughout my studies, I was able to develop theoretical, experimental, modeling, and simulation skills that not only satisfied my scientific curiosity but also fueled it further.  

At the end of my Master’s program, after completing my final internship on wind-measuring LiDAR systems at an *R&D* company, I was convinced that entering the world of research through a PhD would allow me to refine my skills further and fulfill my desire to learn, all while contributing to the advancement of knowledge. And I was not mistaken!

# **Can you summarize your PhD thesis in a few words?**  

The goal of my thesis was to study the performance of a specific type of device called an "Optoelectronic Oscillator." This technology uses laser light to generate radiofrequency waves (typically around 10 GHz) with extremely stable short-term frequencies. Such signals are primarily used in RADAR technologies but can also be applied in telecommunications and as reference signals in scientific instruments like oscilloscopes. We demonstrated state-of-the-art noise performance and expanded the experiment to generate short optical pulse trains (a few picoseconds), thereby broadening the potential applications of this technology.

# **How was your experience during your PhD?**  

My years as a PhD student were undoubtedly some of the best years of my life. Every day, I was able to dedicate my time to exciting activities, such as studying a system and finding solutions to problems from theoretical, simulation, and experimental perspectives. Despite the challenges and the personal demands of a PhD, I was able to learn and make progress on my topic in a stimulating and fulfilling environment. Daily interactions with fellow PhD students, researchers, and engineers enriched me on a human, scientific, and professional level.  

I was also fortunate to participate in various national and international conferences, where I met other members of the scientific community while traveling. Teaching and mentoring interns further convinced me of the importance of sharing knowledge and my passion through pedagogy. If I had to summarize my PhD experience in three words, I would choose: Excitement, Curiosity, and Exchange.

# **What advice would you give to a student considering pursuing a PhD?**  

In my opinion, the most important advice is to find a healthy and pleasant thesis environment, starting with the relationship with your thesis advisor and, secondly, with the rest of the team (researchers, faculty, technicians, engineers, and fellow PhD students). Developing a social environment at work strongly encourages the exchange of skills, mutual support, and discussions beyond work topics, while also fostering friendships.  

A PhD is a demanding endeavor that requires significant personal and mental investment, so it’s crucial to find a balance between personal and professional life. For example, leaving work at the lab helps avoid constantly thinking about the thesis, which can become overwhelming or even obsessive—counterproductive and mentally harmful. In this regard, doctoral training programs and teaching opportunities can serve as breathers and allow you to acquire new skills while staying connected to science (or not).  

It’s also important to cultivate patience and manage frustration. A PhD is a learning journey where scientific results may not appear quickly, either due to the complexity of the subject or practical constraints. With time, effort, and perseverance, the results will eventually come.  

Finally, staying organized is key. Starting a well-structured and annotated bibliography early saves time when writing papers and your thesis manuscript, while also providing quick access to information when needed. Keeping detailed records of experiments, measurements, and conceptual advancements related to your topic also helps streamline daily work and improve efficiency by reducing mental load.
