This project is a personal website/blog built with Hugo, using the 'FixIt' theme. The site is titled "Brian's Homepage" and is hosted at "https://brian-sinquin.github.io/".

Key directories and their purposes:
- `config/_default/`: Contains Hugo configuration files (e.g., `hugo.toml`, `params.toml`).
- `content/`: Stores the website's content in Markdown files, organized into sections like `posts`, `projects`, `publications`, `research`, and `talks`.
- `static/`: Holds static assets such as images, favicons, and other files that are copied directly to the `public` directory.
- `public/`: The output directory for the generated static website.
- `assets/`: Contains SCSS and JavaScript files for custom styling and scripting.
- `layouts/`: Contains custom Hugo layouts for different content types.

The `package.json` file indicates that `npm` scripts are used for building (`npm run build`) and serving (`npm run server`) the Hugo site. The project also includes a `.git` directory, indicating it's under version control, and `.github/workflows` for GitHub Actions, likely for continuous deployment.

In summary, this is a well-structured Hugo site designed for showcasing personal content, with clear separation of configuration, content, and static assets.
